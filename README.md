Implement 3D Unet on the IBRS data set for Sub-cortical structure segmentation

About the data :

Indian Brain Segmentation Dataset(IBSD)

Segmentation of sub-cortical structures from MRI scans is of interest in many neurological diagnoses. Indian Brain Segmentation Dataset (IBSD) consists of high-quality 1.5T T1w MRI data of 114 subjects generated under fixed imaging protocol along with corresponding manual annotation data of 14 sub-cortical structures done by expert radiologists. The number of MR scans in the dataset consists of an approximately equal number of male and female subjects belonging to a young age group (20-30 years). This data has been used to create a template for the young Indian population [1]. This dataset can also be utilized for variety of tasks such as segmenting structures of interest, aligning/ registering images, etc, using traditional methods as well as Deep Learning approaches since it has adequate quantity of high quality data.
